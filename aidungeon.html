           <p>About AI Dungeon</p><p>
AI Dungeon is a first of its kind AI generated text adventure. Using a 1.5B parameter machine learning model called GPT-2, AI Dungeon generates the story and results of your actions as you play in this virtual world. Unlike virtually every other game in existence, you are not limited by the imagination of the developer in what you can do. Any thing you can express in language can be your action and the AI dungeon master will decide how the world responds to your actions.</p><p>
           How to play</p><p>
<p>The rules of AI Dungeon are simple:</p>
<p>1. The game puts "You " to the front of each action so every action should start with a verb. Ex. "attack the dragon", "summon a sandwich" etc...</p>
<p>2. As an exception to the above: If you put your action in quotes Ex. '"Will you join me on my quest?"' then the game will add "You say " to the front of it. </p>
           <p>Commands</p>
           <ul>
           <li>- [!] Enter "!" at the beginning of any action to prevent the game from adding "You" or making any other modifications. Ex "!A troll appears and attacks", "!John declares his undying love to you" etc...</li> 
<li>- [Revert] Click the revert button or type "/revert" for any action to undo the last action. This is helpful if you get a nonsensical response or the game starts looping. Just revert and try something else. </li>
<li>- [Alter] Click the alter button edit the last response from the AI. This is helpful if you get a nonsensical response and want to fix what the AI generated.</li> 
<li>- [Remember] Click the remember button to edit the memory context. The context is fed into the model at each step so the AI will always have that information.</li> </ul><p>
<p>Tips</p>
  <ul>         
  <li>- Try using new words often, the AI gets more creative with variety.</li>
<li>- You can use quotes to speak, ex. "Leave them alone!"</li>
<li>- Remember to start your action with a verb, ex: Attack the orc</li>
<li>- To revert your last input and try something else, enter: /revert</li>
<li>- Long sentences for actions are no problem! Get creative!</li>
<li>- Join the community! Check out the "Explore" section in the sidebar!</li>
<li>- Create your own adventures in "Creator Studio" in the sidebar!</li>
<li>- Want more story to generate? Just press enter without typing in an action.</li>
<li>- Start an action with ! to stop the game from putting "You" in front. Ex "!Suddenly an ogre appears"</li>
<li>- Use the /remember command to have the AI always remember story details. Ex "/remember You are married to a man named Robert."</li>  </ul>    </div>
