	<p id="a">You all. Every one of you. My legion, my friends, my tribe. I see you I know your names and I know you're heard. I know who puts in an honest day’s work. And I know who slacks the system. You know it, too. You know who you are, I SEE YOU. And it’s to you, I say, I’m lowkey-not-lowkey ballistic. You trust me to give you everything, yeah. Food, shelter, warmth, weapons, leadership, safety. Even a beer every now and then. And in return you know what I ask? It’s pretty fucking simple. I ask you don’t murder-kill me. That how this shit is supposed to work. Fair exchange. Right? I mean after everything I’ve built here? Look around you this is our school. Our public school. And a public school takes in anybody. I take in anybody. There's always a seat for you on my bleachers. Doesn't matter your former tribe. Doesn't matter who used to be. You're safe here. I'm the eye in the hurricane nuclear fallout. I'm the SPF 120 protecting you from the heat-blast sun. And once it sets, I'm the only warm blanket you got on this bitter-assed nights. I give you all this, and I ask the simplest things in return. Loyalty. Loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust in like an inch of respect maybe. But mostly loyalty. And would it seriously hurt you to pick up trash every once in awhile. This place is a mess. It's starting to smell like foot cheese. Again: I SEE YOU. A quarterback can't make epic plays without knowing where every single lineman and running back and receiver is. Same here, with you.

My job is impossible unless every lieutenant and soldier and kitchen scut right on down the line is doing their fucking job. Vibe me? Am I getting through? Well, guess what! Y’all betrayed me. Why? I didn't build all this so you fucks could just take it from me. No way. You don't own this. The second you think you do is the second you make it toxic I'm reminded of the immortal words that guy who said whoha in “Any Given Sunday,” “I don't know what to say really. Three minutes to the biggest battle of our professional lives all comes down today. Either we heal as a team or we are going to crumble. Inch by inch. Play-by-play. Till we’re finished. We are in hell right now, gentlemen, Believe me and we can stay here and get the shit kicked out of us or we can find our way back into the light. We can climb out of hell 1 inch, at a time. No I can't do it for you. I'm too old. I look around and see these young faces and I think, I mean, I made every wrong choice middle age men to make. I uh… I pissed away all my money believe it or not. I chased off anyone has ever loved me. Unlikely, I can't even stare at the face I see in the mirror. You know when you get old in life things get taken from you. That’s, that’s part of life. But you only learn that when you start losing stuff. You fins out life is just a game of inches. So is football. Because in either game, life or football, the margin for error is so small. I mean one half step too late or too early you don’t quite make it. One second half second too slow or too fast means you don’t quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. Every break of the game, every minute, every second.

On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves, and everyone around us, to pieces for that inch. We clawed with our fingernails for that inch. Because we know that when we add up all those inches that's gonna make the fucking difference between winning and losing. Between living and dying. I'll tell you this, in any fight the guy who is willing to die is going to win that inch. And I know if I'm gonna have any life any more it is because, I'm still willing to fight, and die for that inch because that is what living is. The 6 inches in front of your face. Now I can't make you do it you gotta look at the guy next to you. Look into his eyes. Now I think you are gonna see a guy who will go the inch with you. You were going to see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he knows when it comes down to it, you were gonna do the same thing for him. That's a team, gentleman and we either heal now, as a team, or we will die as individuals. That’s football guys. That's all it is. Now, whattaya gonna do?” Yeah. That's right. I memorise that whole speech. It took me a whole year. But, I did it. I'm also memorised the speeches from “Hoosiers” and “Remember the Titans” and “Rocky IV” and “Cool Runnings” and “The Mighty Ducks” and “She’s The Man” and “Highschool Musical” and “Friday Night Lights,” both the movie and the television series. So I know about inspiration. I'll tell you this story. It's something I didn't understand at first but now I'm coming around to it. Story my dad told me. There was this guy who used to make vases I don't know what they call that? A Vaser? Maybe? No. That’s wrong. Sculptor. I guess that could be right. A Potter? Maybe a Potter. I wonder if that's why the kids named Harry Potter? Because he made magic. Like made it. What was I saying? Potter? The vase! Right.

These vases were beautiful things. And check this out… The guy would wrap and unfired vase in horse hair — then put it in his kiln. The horsehair would burn off and leave these black, charred scars. But to get the horse hair, the guy would have to pluck it straight from the stallion’s tail. How baller is that? Every time he did it, that stallion would buck. The vase-maker, vases, potter — he was pretty good at dodging the kick. ‘Cause he knew it was coming. But more than once, that horse would get him. Knocking him in the face and shoulder. Nasty shit. Still had rolling shards of broken bone you could feel, with a horse shattered his clavicle. But Christ in a halo, it was worth the pain. Those vases, man. I know you think I'm a dumb jock, but I can appreciate a thing like that. Well, I look out for you all, and I think that's what I've done here. You're the bucking horse. I'm a sculptor. And the beautiful vase is all of this, Glendale high. What we have. But, you fuckers broke the vase. And I'm not sure we can have a glue this thing back together. I'm gonna try. I'm really gonna fucking try.</p>
